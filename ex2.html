The selectors announced two squads, an 18-member common one for the one-off Test and the three-match ODI series, set to be led by Mithali Raj, along with a 17-member squad for the T20Is, to be led by Harmanpreet Kaur</p>

Shikha Pandey and Tanya Bhatia, who were dropped for the ODI and the T20I series against South Africa at home, too have been called back. Uncapped wicket-keeper, Indrani Roy, finds herself in both squads along, while left arm spinner, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, who hasn't recovered from a bout of Covid-19, has been left out.</p>
